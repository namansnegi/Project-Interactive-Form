## Interactive Form

###### This is the third project for the üè° Treehouse Techdegree

The aim of the project is to add useful interactivity to a web form to make forms "smarter" and responsive to what your users do.

## Key Requirements for the project

You'll need to use a regular expression to get this requirement. See the list of Resources for links to learn about regular expressions.
- At least one activity must be checked from the list under "Register for Actitivities."
