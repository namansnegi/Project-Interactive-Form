## Interactive Form

###### This is the third project for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree

The aim of the project is to add useful interactivity to a web form to make forms "smarter" and responsive to what your users do.

## Key Requirements for the project

- [X] On page load, the cursor appears in the "Name" field, ready for a user to type.

- [X] "Other job role" text field displays/hides when a user selects/deselects "Other" from the Job Role menu.

- [X] The "Color" field is disabled when the page loads.

- [X] The "Color" field is enabled when a "Theme" is selected.

- [X] Both the "Color" field, and the "Color" drop down menu update correctly when a T-Shirt theme is selected or changed.

- [X] The total cost of selected activities correctly updates in the form when users select or deselect activities.

- [X] When the page loads, "Credit Card" is selected in the payment field, and the credit card section is the only payment section displayed in the form’s UI.

- [X] The payment section updates correctly when the user changes the selected payment method in the drop down menu.

- [X] Form submission uses the submit event on the form element.

- [X] Form cannot be submitted (the page does not refresh when the submit button is clicked) until the following requirements have been met:
- "Name" field isn’t blank.
- "Email" field contains a correctly formatted email address (like namansnegi@hotmail.com).
- At least one activity has been selected.
- If "Credit Card" is the selected payment option, the three credit card fields accept only numbers: a 13 to 16-digit credit card number, a 5-digit zip code, and 3-digit CVV value.

- [X] When all the required fields are filled out correctly, the form submits (the page refreshes on its own when the submit button is clicked).
